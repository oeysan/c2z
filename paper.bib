        {BibLaTeX} is a complete reimplementation of the bibliographic
        facilities provided by {LaTeX}. Formatting of the bibliography is
        entirely controlled by {LaTeX} macros, and a working knowledge of
        {LaTeX} should be sufficient to design new bibliography and citation
        styles. {BibLaTeX} uses its own data backend program called “biber” to
        read and process the bibliographic data. With biber, {BibLaTeX} has
        many features rivalling or surpassing other bibliography systems.
