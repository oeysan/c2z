	abstract = {In the contentious debate over the use of randomized clinical trials ({RCTs}) in education research, little attention has been given to how methodological issues arise and/or are resolved in the implementation of random assignment. Following a review of the methodological-theoretical literature on {RCTs} and alternative research designs, this article analyzes qualitative and quantitative data on three years of random assignment in a multi-site literacy intervention for adolescents. Practical lessons are drawn about how researcher practices and learning by school staff contributed to random assignment compliance. Consideration of challenges encountered in implementing random assignment suggests that 1) researcher communication with program staff improves compliance, but may not overcome the need for learning through experience; 2) in keeping with arguments in favor of random assignment-based research, random assignment may control for diverse selection processes that would undermine valid treatment-control comparisons in some non-{RCT} research designs; and 3) in keeping with arguments against random assignment-based research, random assignment may lead to samples dissimilar to target populations. In concluding, the broader limitations of research that focus on a priori causes and quantifiable effects are noted},

	abstract = {Visual working memory ({VWM}) is reliably predictive of fluid intelligence and academic achievements. The objective of the current study was to investigate the nature of individual differences in pre-schoolers by examining the relationship between behaviour-brain function underlying {VWM} processing and parent-reported measures. We used a portable 8 x 8 channel functional near-infrared spectroscopy system to record from the frontal and parietal cortices of 4.5-year-old pre-school children (N=74) as they completed a colour change detection {VWM} task in their homes. Parents were asked to fill in questionnaires on temperament, academic aspirations, home environment, and life stress. Children were median-split into a low-performing ({LP}) and a high-performing ({HP}) group based on the number of items they could successfully remember during the task. {LPs} increasingly activated the bilateral frontal and parietal cortices with increasing load, whereas {HPs} showed no difference in activation across the loads. Our findings suggested that {LPs} recruited more neural resources when their {VWM} capacity was challenged. We employed mediation analyses to examine the association between the difference in activation between the highest and lowest loads, and variables from the questionnaires. The difference in activation in the right parietal cortex partially mediated the association between parent-reported stressful life events and {VWM} performance. Specifically, a higher number of stressful events was associated with lower {VWM} performance. Critically, our findings show that the association between {VWM} capacity, right parietal activation, and indicators of life stress is important to understand the nature of individual differences in {VWM} in pre-school children},

	abstract = {Background: Cheese is a major source of long-chained vitamin K2 variants. How intake of vitamin K2 rich cheese affects vitamin K and osteocalcin has not been studied. The aim was to establish a maximum efficacy dose ({MED}) after daily intake of vitamin K2-rich cheese (Jarlsberg®) based on increase in ratio between carboxylated and undercarboxylated osteocalcin during a five-week diet.Methods: 20 healthy healthy volunteers ({HV}) were recruited. The daily intake of Jarlsberg® cheese in the study varied from 20 to 152 g. Clinical investigation was performed initially and after three, four and five weeks with measurement of vital signs, hematological and biochemical variables, carboxylated and undercarboxylated osteocalcin and vitamin K. The ratio {OR}= carboxylated/undercarboxylated osteocalcin was the main variable.Results: The {MED} decreased with treatment duration and was estimated to 57 g/day (95\% {CI}: 47-67) after five weeks diet, resulting in a mean {OR} increase of 30\% (95\% {CI}: 23.8-36.8). Both {OR} and serum osteocalcin followed a quadratic dose response curve. For osteocalcin, a maximal increase of 46\% was estimated at 59 g/day for five weeks. The serum content of long-chained vitamin K2 increased significantly with increasing cheese dose. The increase were mainly obtained the first three weeks and kept unchanged the following two weeks. The cheese doses close to the {MED} caused nearly significant reductions in total cholesterol, {LDL}-cholesterol, the {LDL}/{HDL} ratio and significant reduction in the blood pressures after five weeks diet (p≤0.05).Conclusions: {MED} of Jarlsberg® cheese was estimated to 57 g/day. Daily intake of Jarlsberg® cheese increased the osteocalcin level, vitamin K2 and positively affected the lipid patterns and blood pressure.},

The edible fresh acid-curd cheese coating was composed of 100\% (w/w) liquid acid whey protein concentrate ({LAWPC}), apple pectin, sunflower oil, and glycerol containing 6 log10 {CFU}/{mL} of strain biomass applied on cheese by dipping. The cheese samples were examined over 21 days of storage for changes of microbiological criteria ({LAB}, yeast and mould, coliform, enterobacteria, and lipolytic microorganism), physicochemical ({pH}, lactic acid, protein, fat, moisture content, and colour), rheological, and sensory properties. The coating significantly improved appearance and slowed down discolouration of cheese by preserving moisture during prolonged storage. The immobilisation of L. helveticus cells into the coating had no negative effect on their viability throughout 14 days of storage at 4 °C and 23 °C. The application of coating with immobilised cells on cheeses significantly decreased the counts of yeast up to 1 log10 {CFU}/g during 14 days (p {\textless} 0.05) of storage and suppressed growth of mould for 21 days resulting in improved flavour of curd cheese at the end of storage. These findings indicate that {LAWPC}-pectin formulation provided an excellent matrix to support L. helveticus cell viability. Acting as protective antimicrobial barrier in fresh cheeses, this bioactive coating can reduce microbial contamination after processing enabling the producers to extend the shelf life of this perishable product},

	abstract = {Across many species, scream calls signal the affective significance of events to other agents. Scream calls were often thought to be of generic alarming and fearful nature, to signal potential threats, with instantaneous, involuntary, and accurate recognition by perceivers. However, scream calls are more diverse in their affective signaling nature than being limited to fearfully alarming a threat, and thus the broader sociobiological relevance of various scream types is unclear. Here we used 4 different psychoacoustic, perceptual decision-making, and neuroimaging experiments in humans to demonstrate the existence of at least 6 psychoacoustically distinctive types of scream calls of both alarming and non-alarming nature, rather than there being only screams caused by fear or aggression. Second, based on perceptual and processing sensitivity measures for decision-making during scream recognition, we found that alarm screams (with some exceptions) were overall discriminated the worst, were responded to the slowest, and were associated with a lower perceptual sensitivity for their recognition compared with non-alarm screams. Third, the neural processing of alarm compared with non-alarm screams during an implicit processing task elicited only minimal neural signal and connectivity in perceivers, contrary to the frequent assumption of a threat processing bias of the primate neural system. These findings show that scream calls are more diverse in their signaling and communicative nature in humans than previously assumed, and, in contrast to a commonly observed threat processing bias in perceptual discriminations and neural processes, we found that especially non-alarm screams, and positive screams in particular, seem to have higher efficiency in speeded discriminations and the implicit neural processing of various scream types in humans.},
